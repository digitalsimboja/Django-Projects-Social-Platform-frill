# frill
Frill is a social media platform for learning new languages from Natives willing to teach some core language constructs for Free. Users select what they are willing to learn and according to what Natives advertise. Realtime possibilities but passive at first. Users select the language of choice by watching videos of Natives speaking and explaining the meaning of the words and constructs in the Language. I am an African but I want to learn Native Thai Lanaguage. I would come to Frill and watch Natives speak and explain the language to me.
